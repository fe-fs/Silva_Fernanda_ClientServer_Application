Hello! This is an assigment project for my class Software Development I

This is a JavaFX application that acts as a server in a client-server architecture. 
It receives a radius value from a client, calculates the area, and sends it back to the client.

In a client-server architecture, both the client and the server need to be running at the same time for them to communicate. Here’s how you can do it:

Run the Server: First, start the Server application. This will make the server start listening for connections.

Run the Client: After the server is up and running, you can start the Client application.
The client will attempt to connect to the server and start sending requests.

Remember, both applications must be running simultaneously, but the server needs to be started before the client. 
This is because the client attempts to connect to the server as soon as it starts, and if the server isn’t running, the connection will fail.

There is a JAR file for this application.
